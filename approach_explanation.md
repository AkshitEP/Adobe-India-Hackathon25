# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview

Our solution implements a multi-stage intelligent document analysis system that extracts and prioritizes document sections based on specific user personas and their job requirements. The methodology combines traditional information retrieval techniques with modern semantic understanding to deliver contextually relevant content extraction.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

We utilize **PyMuPDF** as our primary PDF processing engine due to its superior speed and accuracy in text extraction. The system extracts structured content including text blocks, font information, spatial coordinates, and hierarchical relationships from input documents. Each document is parsed into semantic sections using font analysis, whitespace detection, and structural pattern recognition.

### 2. Semantic Analysis Framework

Our approach implements a **hybrid BM25 + Semantic Ranking** system that combines:

- **Lexical Matching**: BM25 algorithm for keyword-based relevance scoring between persona descriptions, job requirements, and document sections
- **Semantic Understanding**: DistilBERT-based embeddings for deep contextual similarity analysis
- **Structural Importance**: Document hierarchy analysis considering section positioning, font characteristics, and formatting patterns

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Relevance Scoring

The core innovation lies in our multi-dimensional scoring algorithm that evaluates document sections across four key dimensions:

**Persona Alignment (40%)**: Measures how well document content matches the specified persona's expertise domain and focus areas using domain-specific vocabulary analysis and professional terminology matching.

**Job Relevance (40%)**: Quantifies section relevance to the specific job-to-be-done through task-oriented keyword analysis and contextual similarity scoring.

**Content Quality (15%)**: Assesses information density, factual content, and comprehensiveness using statistical text analysis and entity recognition.

**Structural Significance (5%)**: Evaluates section importance based on document positioning, formatting emphasis, and hierarchical level.

### 4. Lightweight Model Integration

To meet the 1GB model constraint, we employ **DistilBERT** (274MB) for semantic understanding, which retains 97% of BERT's performance while being significantly faster and smaller. The model is fine-tuned on domain-specific document datasets to enhance relevance scoring accuracy.

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Vectorized Processing**: NumPy-based mathematical operations for efficient similarity calculations and ranking algorithms.

**Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded document analysis leveraging all available CPU cores to process document collections within the 60-second constraint.

**Memory Management**: Streaming document processing to handle large document collections without memory overflow.

**Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching of computed embeddings and similarity scores to avoid redundant calculations.

## Output Generation

The system generates structured JSON output containing ranked document sections, subsection analysis, and relevance metadata. Each extracted section includes precise page references, importance rankings, and refined text snippets optimized for the specific persona and job requirements.

This methodology ensures high precision in section relevance while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability across diverse document types and persona combinations.
